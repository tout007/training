Ruby is a pure Object-Oriented language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Everything
in Ruby is an object except the blocks but there are replacements too for it i.e 
procs and lambda. The objective of Rubyâ€™s development was to make it act as a 
sensible buffer between human programmers and the underlying computing machinery."
